# Gemini Codebase Understanding

This document provides a high-level overview of the `poker-client` project, generated by analyzing the existing codebase.

## Project Overview

This is a web-based poker game client built using the Phaser 3 game engine. The project is set up with a modern development environment using Vite for fast builds and a hot-reloading development server, and TypeScript for type-safe code.

The game currently initializes, preloads assets with a loading screen, and then transitions to a main scene that displays a welcome message and a sample game asset. It also features a separate, parallel scene for UI elements like a score display.

## Technology Stack

- **Game Engine:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool / Dev Server:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Linting:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- **Formatting:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- **Package Manager:** [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean, organized structure:

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets that are copied directly to the build output.
  - **`public/assets/`**: The primary location for all game assets like images, audio, and spritesheets.
- **`src/`**: The main source code directory.
  - **`main.ts`**: The main entry point of the application. It initializes the Phaser game instance.
  - **`game.ts`**: Defines the global Phaser game configuration, including screen dimensions and the list of scenes.
  - **`common/`**: Contains shared logic, such as asset definitions (`assets.ts`).
  - **`scenes/`**: Contains the different game scenes.
    - **`preload.scene.ts`**: Responsible for loading all game assets before the game starts. Displays a progress bar.
    - **`main.scene.ts`**: The primary scene for gameplay.
    - **`ui.scene.ts`**: A dedicated scene for UI elements, running in parallel to the main scene.
  - **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions, custom types (`types.ts`), and enumerations (`enums.ts`).
- **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for the Vite development server and build process.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler options.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The game will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server with hot reloading.
- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript code and builds the project for production.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase for potential errors.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats all code using Prettier.
